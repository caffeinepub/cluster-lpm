  "summary": "The diff modifies LoginPage.tsx to fix the infinite loading issue on the login page. The implementation addresses all acceptance criteria: it handles the login flow, resolves loading states, redirects to correct dashboards based on profile/admin status, redirects to profile setup when no profile exists, handles errors with visible alerts and retry buttons, and handles the 'already authenticated' edge case. No files under the constrained paths (useInternetIdentity.ts, useActor.ts) were modified, and no backend changes were made.",
