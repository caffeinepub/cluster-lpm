  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to frontend authentication files that partially address the build request. REQ-1 appears to be addressed through changes to LoginPage.tsx that restore and improve the authentication flow. REQ-2 is not explicitly addressed in the visible diff - there's no evidence of removing or fixing the 'already authenticated' error message from Version 16.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Remove or fix the 'user is already authenticated' error message that appears after successful login in Version 16",
      "reason": "The diff shows LoginPage.tsx with authentication logic but no visible changes that specifically remove or handle an 'already authenticated' error message. The file calculates hasValidSession locally and redirects authenticated users, but there's no code removing error messages related to 'already authenticated' status.",

      "reason": "The LoginPage.tsx implements a LoginStage type and getStatusText() function to display different status messages during login flow. This granular progress tracking was not part of the requirements.",
